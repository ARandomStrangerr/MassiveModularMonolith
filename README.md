Why it is called Modular Monolith?  
We all understand that Modular programs cut the program into slices and runs independently  
However, some part of this program still depends on eachother, which makes it Monolith.
Since the original company have bunch of Pentium Gold CPUs, and the owner requested that the modular can be plug and use; hence, I come up with this mess.
